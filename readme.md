# Web scrape the local election results for Leeds 2019 into a csv format

These results will be published on datamillnorth in 2 weeks but before then you can use this jupyter notebook to either scrape them yourself or simply download the pre-scraped .csv.

Vote shares are included and calculated.

This notebook uses Selenium which requires a web browser driver (in this case i've used chrome, drivers available https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
